# TransCrab

TransCrab is **OpenClaw-first**: a small, stable capability you add to an OpenClaw assistant so it can turn links into a polished translated reading page.

This is not a generic “for humans” app. It’s a **template for OpenClaw assistants** (bots) to install, operate, and keep updated.

---

## What you get

After setup, your OpenClaw assistant can take a link + the keyword `crab` and:

1) fetch the page
2) extract main content
3) convert HTML → Markdown
4) translate Markdown (default: zh-Hans)
5) commit + push to your repo
6) Netlify rebuilds → you get a page URL

---

## Install (human prompt)

Send this to your OpenClaw assistant:

> Help me install and deploy TransCrab:
> https://github.com/onevcat/transcrab

---

## Install (for OpenClaw assistant / bot)

Follow the steps below. You may also refer to `scripts/BOOTSTRAP.md`.

### 0) Ask the user for required info

- Their fork repo URL (or permission to fork `onevcat/transcrab` into their account)
- Their Netlify site URL (or whether they want you to create/configure it)
- Preferred default translation target language (default: `zh`)
- Preferred model (default: `openai-codex/gpt-5.2`)

### 1) Repo + Netlify deployment

- Fork/clone the repo into the user’s workspace
- Ensure `npm i` and `npm run build` succeed
- Deploy the user’s fork on Netlify:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `dist`

### 2) Runtime behavior contract (conversation UX)

- Do **not** run the pipeline on URL alone.
- Only run the default pipeline when the user sends a URL and then sends `crab`.
- If the user provides explicit instructions, follow them instead:
  - `raw <url>`: store source only
  - `sum <url>`: summary only
  - `tr:<lang> <url>`: translate to another language

### 3) Pipeline responsibilities

On `URL + crab`:

- Fetch and extract content (start with simple fetch; fall back to stronger extraction if needed)
- Convert to Markdown while preserving structure
- Translate Markdown to target language
  - Preserve Markdown structure
  - Do not translate code blocks / commands / URLs / file paths
- Write under `content/articles/<slug>/`:
  - `source.md`, `<lang>.md` (e.g. `zh.md`), `meta.json`
- Commit + push to `main`
- Reply to the user with the resulting page URL

---

## Updating (when this template changes)

In a fork clone:

```bash
./scripts/sync-upstream.sh
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- OpenClaw gateway running locally
- A configured model provider in OpenClaw (default suggested: `openai-codex/gpt-5.2`)
